This file is to outline fixes for the Nav2 tutorial problems that occurred while following the
online tutorial. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. While "Setting up the URDF": the tutorial is vague about how to enter the data in the urdf.
   Data should be entered as follows:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="sam_bot" xmlns:xacro="http://ros.org/wiki/xacro">   <----- Begins Tag

****************ENTER CODE HERE WITHIN TAG*********************

</robot>   <----- Ends Tag

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. While "Setting up Odometry": TF_OLD_DATA: Occurs when data is out of date when compared to 
   simulation time. This happens during the verification in the localization portion of the 
   tutorial. It happens because not all of the nodes have been set to run on "sim_time". To do
   this, add the following line at the end of each node in the display.launch.py file:

    joint_state_publisher_node = launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='joint_state_publisher',
        executable='joint_state_publisher',
        name='joint_state_publisher',
        parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True}]   <-----This line needs added to every node
    )                                               as shown here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. While setting up the costmap, the tutorial says to include a section of 
   code into the nav2 configuration file. This file needs to be made under
   the config folder with name nav2_params.yaml. It will include all 
   parameters for the navigation.
