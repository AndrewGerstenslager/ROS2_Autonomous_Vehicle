robot_library is our parameters and dokalman as the urdf body

use . create_package.sh to build and locate library to the current terminal

go to useful_commands.txt to see what to run (run all commands in the robot_library/ folder in the terminal)

libraries are held at /opt/ros/humble/share/{PACKAGE_NAME}

    you can restart nav2 and slam without resetting rviz and gazebo but you gotta press the reset button 
    in rviz on the bottom left corner of the window
