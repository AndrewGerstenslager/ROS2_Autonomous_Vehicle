if you type lsusb in the command line in wsl or in a linux-based docker container you will see that
the usb devices from windows are not listed. This is not what we want because we want to be able to
access and use data from devices like cameras or other things.

Summary:
install the program usbipd for windows and set it up. you should be able to run it from the terminal/powershell
run usbipd list to see the available devices
determine what device you'd like to connect.
Here is some example output:

I chose the 3-2    046d:08e5  HD Pro Webcam C920 device for This

I then run usbipd wsl attach --busid 3-2

If things went correctly the device is shared to the WSL backend and subsequently the Docker engine.

How to verify:
run lsusb and you will see the device listed now as an available device

CURRENT ISSUE:
how do I access the file path of the device? ls /dev does not give me a file path that I can use for the camera
