if you set up the dev container and run xclock or xeyes and get the error:
"Error: Can't open display:"

Try to run:
echo $DISPLAY

and see if the output is empty or not. If it is empty you will have to:

install an XServer for windows (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)

- Run the XServer:
    - find the location of the downloaded program
    - run the XLaunch program
        - Display Settings: Multiple windows
        - Client Startup: Start no Client
        - Extra Settings: All settings checked
        - Hit Finish
- Open up the terminal and run linux
    - In that terminal run: export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0
    - When you run echo $DISPLAY you should see something like: 172.26.128.1:0 if it ran correctly
- Rebuild the docker container in VSCode
- In the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json the parameter for "DISPLAY": "host.docker.internal:0" should hopefully fix it
- You can verify that it worked by running in the docker terminal echo $DISPLAY and see the same thing show up as before
- Run xeyes or xclock and hopefully the issue is resolved
